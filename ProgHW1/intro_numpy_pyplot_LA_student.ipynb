    "Sometimes instead of plotting a curve, you may just want to plot point(s) (for example, if you are plotting a dataset). Here is an example where we plot two points,  one at position $(2, 1)$ and one in position $(3, 4)$. Note that the only difference with plotting a line passing through these two points is the optional argument `'o'`. The marker `o` indicates that our points are represented by a circle. Try to replace `'o'` by `'s'` (the marker will become a square) or `'r.'` (the marker will be a small red circle)."

    "We will now plot datasets for two different populations. Those datasets come from the famous [iris dataset](https:////en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). In the file `iris_cetosa.csv`, you can find the measurements for $50$ different iris from the species *cetosa*. Each iris is characterized by four features: `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length` and `petal_width`. Similarly, in the file `iris_versicolour.csv`, you can find the measurements of the same features for $50$ iris from the species *versicolour*.\n",
